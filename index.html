                <h1>WHAT IS JAVA?</h1>
                <h3>Java is a programming language and computing platform that was first released in 1995. It is one of the most popular programming languages today, with an estimated 10 million developers worldwide. Java is used for various applications, including web development, mobile apps, and enterprise software. Java is a versatile and powerful language that enables developers to create robust, high-performance applications. The Java platform provides developers with comprehensive tools to build, test, and deploy their applications. Java also has a rich set of libraries and frameworks that can be used to create sophisticated applications.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>Object-oriented programming (OOP) helps developers design more maintainable and easier-to-understand software. OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism make it possible to create robust and scalable applications. Java is an object-oriented language that enables developers to create reusable code modules. Java is platform-independent, meaning that programs written in Java can run on any hardware or operating system. This makes it ideal for developing cross-platform applications. Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can be executed by any Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>Security is an important feature of Java. Java provides a secure environment for applications to run in. It uses a security model based on the sandboxing concept, meaning that applications and the underlying operating system are isolated from each other. This prevents malicious code from accessing sensitive data or damaging the system. Additionally, Java has built-in security features such as authentication and authorization, which allow developers to control who has access to their applications and data.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>Java also provides a secure development environment. It includes static analysis tools that can detect potential security vulnerabilities in code before deployment. Additionally, Java provides secure coding guidelines that help developers write secure code. These guidelines include best practices such as using strong encryption and avoiding common security vulnerabilities.</h3>
                <br>
